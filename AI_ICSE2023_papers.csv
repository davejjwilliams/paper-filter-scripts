DW,True,Log Parsing with Prompt-Based Few-Shot Learning,"Le, Van-Hoang, Zhang, Hongyu",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00204,"Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.",False,False,False,True

Before bug fixing, developers need to reproduce the bugs which is an extremely time-consuming and tedious task, and it is highly expected to automate this process. However, it is challenging to do so considering the imprecise or incomplete natural language described in reproducing steps, and the missing or ambiguous single source of information in GUI components. In this paper, we propose a context-aware bug reproduction approach ScopeDroid which automatically reproduces crashes from textual bug reports for mobile apps. It first constructs a state transition graph (STG) and extracts the contextual information of components. We then design a multi-modal neural matching network to derive the fuzzy matching matrix between all candidate GUI events and reproducing steps. With the STG and matching information, it plans the exploration path for reproducing the bug, and enriches the initial STG iteratively. We evaluate the approach on 102 bug reports from 69 popular Android apps, and it successfully reproduces 63.7% of the crashes, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by 32.6% and 38.3%. We also evaluate the usefulness and robustness of ScopeDroid with promising results. Furthermore, to train the neural matching network, we develop a heuristic-based automated training data generation method, which can potentially motivate and facilitate other activities as user interface operations.",False,False,False,True

These databases record the libraries related to each vulnerability. However, the vulnerability reports may not explicitly list every library and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries. Human analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for automated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to automatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme multi-label learning (XML).While state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their experimental settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous studies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing their models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This may unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the models on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives chronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen libraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of current XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to 0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of vulnerability reports.We propose a practical library identification approach, namely Chronos, based on zero-shot learning. The novelty of Chronos is three-fold. First, Chronos fits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of vulnerability reports. Second, Chronos enriches the data of the vulnerability descriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step. Third, Chronos exploits the temporal ordering of the vulnerability reports using a cache to prioritize prediction of versions of libraries that recently had reports of vulnerabilities.In our experiments, Chronos achieves an average F1-score of 0.75, 3x better than the best XML-based approach. Data enhancement and the time-aware adjustment improve Chronos over the vanilla zero-shot learning model by 27% in average F1.",True,False,True,True

Therefore, it popularizes Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS), where general users can access the trained models of MLaaS providers via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) on a pay-per-query basis. Unfortunately, the success of MLaaS is under threat from model extraction attacks, where attackers intend to extract a local model of equivalent functionality to the target MLaaS model. However, existing studies on model extraction of text analytics APIs frequently assume adversaries have strong knowledge about the victim model, like its architecture and parameters, which hardly holds in practice. Besides, since the attacker's and the victim's training data can be considerably discrepant, it is non-trivial to perform efficient model extraction. In this paper, to advance the understanding of such attacks, we propose a framework, PEEP, for practical and efficient model extraction of sentiment analysis APIs with only query access. Specifically, PEEP features a learning-based scheme, which employs out-of-domain public corpora and a novel query strategy to construct proxy training data for model extraction. Besides, PEEP introduces a greedy search algorithm to settle an appropriate architecture for the extracted model. We conducted extensive experiments with two victim models across three datasets and two real-life commercial sentiment analysis APIs.

Automatically transferring code style to user's preference or consistency can facilitate project cooperation and maintenance, as well as maximize the value of open-source code. Existing work on automating code stylization is either limited to code formatting or requires human supervision in pre-defining style checking and transformation rules. In this paper, we present unsupervised methods to assist automatic code style transfer for arbitrary code styles. The main idea is to leverage Big Code database to learn style and content embedding separately to generate or retrieve a piece of code with the same functionality and the desired target style. We carefully encode style and content features, so that a style embedding can be learned from arbitrary code. We explored the capabilities of novel attention-based style generation models and meta-learning and implemented our ideas in DUETCS. We complement the learning-based approach with a retrieval mode, which uses the same embeddings to directly search for the desired piece of code in Big Code.

However, the existing detection methods can only identify the presence of a patch (i.e., a binary classification) but fail to pinpoint the vulnerability type. In this work, we take the first step to categorize the security patches into fine-grained vulnerability types. Specifically, we use the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) as the label and perform fine-grained classification using categories at the third level of the CWE tree. We first formulate the task as a Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC) problem, i.e., inferring a path (a sequence of CWE nodes) from the root of the CWE tree to the node at the target depth. We then propose an approach named TreeVul with a hierarchical and chained architecture, which manages to utilize the structure information of the CWE tree as prior knowledge of the classification task. We further propose a tree structure aware and beam search based inference algorithm for retrieving the optimal path with the highest merged probability. We collect a large security patch dataset from NVD, consisting of 6,541 commits from 1,560 GitHub OSS repositories. Experimental results show that TreeVul significantly outperforms the best performing baselines, with improvements of 5.9%, 25.0%, and 7.7% in terms of weighted F1-score, macro F1-score, and MCC, respectively.

To resolve the above challenges, we propose RepresentThemAll, a pre-trained approach that can learn the universal representation of bug reports and handle multiple downstream tasks.

Automatic data generation would promisingly meet the need, yet there is little work aimed to generate much-needed quality vulnerable samples. Meanwhile, existing similar and adaptable techniques suffer critical limitations for that purpose. In this paper, we present VULGEN, the first injection-based vulnerability-generation technique that is not limited to a particular class of vulnerabilities. VULGEN combines the strengths of deterministic (pattern-based) and probabilistic (deep-learning/DL-based) program transformation approaches while mutually overcoming respective weaknesses. This is achieved through close collaborations between pattern mining/application and DL-based injection localization, which separates the concerns with how and where to inject. By leveraging large, pretrained programming language modeling and only learning locations, VULGEN mitigates its own needs for quality vulnerability data (for training the localization model). Extensive evaluations show that VULGEN significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art (SOTA) pattern-based peer technique as well as both Transformer- and GNN-based approaches in terms of the percentages of generated samples that are vulnerable and those also exactly matching the ground truth (by 38.0--430.1% and 16.3--158.2%, respectively).

From this data, we model the decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse, including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We substantiate these identified challenges with systematic measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem.

In this paper, we propose QAssist - a question-answering (QA) approach that provides automated assistance to stakeholders, including requirements engineers, during the analysis of NL requirements. Posing a question and getting an instant answer is beneficial in various quality-assurance scenarios, e.g., incompleteness detection.

The coverage is characterized via neurons having certain outputs, or the discrepancy between neuron outputs. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that neuron coverage criteria show little correlation with test suite quality.In general, DNNs approximate distributions, by incorporating hierarchical layers, to make predictions for inputs. Thus, we champion to deduce DNN behaviors based on its approximated distributions from a layer perspective. A test suite should be assessed using its induced layer output distributions. Accordingly, to fully examine DNN behaviors, input mutation should be directed toward diversifying the approximated distributions.This paper summarizes eight design requirements for DNN coverage criteria, taking into account distribution properties and practical concerns. We then propose a new criterion, Neural Coverage (NLC), that satisfies all design requirements. NLC treats a single DNN layer as the basic computational unit (rather than a single neuron) and captures four critical properties of neuron output distributions. Thus, NLC accurately describes how DNNs comprehend inputs via approximated distributions. We demonstrate that NLC is significantly correlated with the diversity of a test suite across a number of tasks (classification and generation) and data formats (image and text). Its capacity to discover DNN prediction errors is promising. Test input mutation guided by NLC results in a greater quality and diversity of exposed erroneous behaviors.",True,False,False,True

Prior work has shown that many OSS projects experience large, episodic changes over short periods of time, which can propel them or drag them down. However, sustainable projects typically manage to come out unscathed from such changes, while others do not. The natural questions arise: Can we identify the back-and-forth between governance and socio-technical structure that lead to sustainability following episodic events? And, how about those that do not lead to sustainability?From a data set of social, technical, and policy digital traces from 262 sustainability-labeled ASF incubator projects, here we employ a large-scale empirical study to characterize episodic changes in socio-technical aspects measured by Change Intervals (CI), governance rules and regulations in a form of Institutional Statements (IS), and the temporal relationships between them. We find that sustainable projects during episodic changes can adapt themselves to institutional statements more efficiently, and that institutional discussions can lead to episodic changes intervals in socio-technical aspects of the projects, and vice versa.

Here, we propose a novel test-program generation approach (called MCS) to further improving the performance of compiler testing. MCS conducts memoized search via multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) for guiding the construction of effective test configurations based on the memoization for the explored test configurations during the on-the-fly compiler-testing process. During the process, the elaborate coordination among configuration options can be also well learned by multi-agent RL, which is required for generating bug-triggering test programs. Specifically, MCS considers the diversity among test configurations to efficiently explore the input space and the testing results under each explored configuration to learn which portions of space are more bug-triggering.

Online testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with their application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop, taking into account the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments. However, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might change during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to violate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the execution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the space of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they changed and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously.In this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Online Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT leverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while relying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more likely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives. We empirically evaluate MORLOT using CARLA, a high-fidelity simulator widely used for autonomous driving research, integrated with Transfuser, a DNN-enabled ADS for end-to-end driving.

These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific downstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence suggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known about the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is just one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the natural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored for the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the model's performance. For example, in the case of code summarization, a tailored pre-training objective could be the identification of an appropriate name for a given method, considering the method name to generate as an extreme summary. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training objectives on the performance of transformers when automating code-related tasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the pre-training objectives used in SE. Then, we pre-train 32 transformers using both (i) generic pre-training objectives usually adopted in SE; and (ii) pre-training objectives tailored to specific code-related tasks subject of our experimentation, namely bug-fixing, code summarization, and code completion. We also compare the pre-trained models with non pre-trained ones and show the advantage brought by pre-training in different scenarios, in which more or less fine-tuning data are available. Our results show that: (i) pre-training helps in boosting performance only if the amount of fine-tuning data available is small; (ii) the MLM objective is usually sufficient to maximize the prediction performance of the model, even when comparing it with pre-training objectives specialized for the downstream task at hand.",False,False,False,True

In this work, we propose the concept of Query Plan Guidance (QPG) for guiding automated testing towards ""interesting"" test cases. SQL and other query languages are declarative. Thus, to execute a query, the database system translates every operator in the source language to one of the potentially many so-called physical operators that can be executed; the tree of physical operators is referred to as the query plan. Our intuition is that by steering testing towards exploring a variety of unique query plans, we also explore more interesting behaviors---some of which are potentially incorrect.

Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly.",False,False,False,True

In this paper, we investigate how to use recent machine-learning-based knowledge extraction techniques to automatically identify pairs of comparable API methods and the sentences describing the comparison from Stack Overflow answers. We first built a prototype that can be stocked with a dataset of comparable API methods and provides tool-tips to users in search results and in API documentation. We conducted a user study with this tool based on a dataset of TensorFlow comparable API methods spanning 198 hand-annotated facts from Stack Overflow posts. This study confirmed that providing comparable API methods can be useful for helping developers understand the design space of APIs: developers using our tool were significantly more aware of the comparable API methods and better understood the differences between them. We then created SOREL, an comparable API methods knowledge extraction tool trained on our hand-annotated corpus, which achieves a 71% precision and 55% recall at discovering our manually extracted facts and discovers 433 pairs of comparable API methods from thousands of unseen Stack Overflow posts.

Given the abundance of relevant posts, navigating them and comparing different solutions is tedious and time-consuming. Recent work has proposed to automatically summarize SO posts to concise text to facilitate the navigation of SO posts. However, these techniques rely only on information retrieval methods or heuristics for text summarization, which is insufficient to handle the ambiguity and sophistication of natural language.This paper presents a deep learning based framework called Assort for SO post summarization. Assort includes two complementary learning methods, AssortS and AssortIS, to address the lack of labeled training data for SO post summarization. AssortS is designed to directly train a novel ensemble learning model with BERT embeddings and domain-specific features to account for the unique characteristics of SO posts. By contrast, AssortIS is designed to reuse pre-trained models while addressing the domain shift challenge when no training data is present (i.e., zero-shot learning). Both AssortS and AssortIS outperform six existing techniques by at least 13% and 7% respectively in terms of the F1 score. Furthermore, a human study shows that participants significantly preferred summaries generated by AssortS and AssortIS over the best baseline, while the preference difference between AssortS and AssortIS was small.",False,False,False,True

For supporting their confidential computing, state-of-the-art approaches deploy Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) in enclaves and perform confidential computing on JVMs. Meanwhile, these JVM-in-enclave solutions still suffer from serious limitations, such as heavy overheads of running JVMs in enclaves, large attack surfaces, and deep computation stacks. To mitigate the above limitations, we formalize a Secure Closed-World (SCW) principle and then propose Lejacon, a lightweight and efficient approach to Java confidential computing. The key idea is, given a Java application, to (1) separately compile its confidential computing tasks into a bundle of Native Confidential Computing (NCC) services; (2) run the NCC services in enclaves on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) side, and meanwhile run the non-confidential code on a JVM on the Rich Execution Environment (REE) side. The two sides interact with each other, protecting confidential computing tasks and as well keeping the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size small.We implement Lejacon and evaluate it against OcclumJ (a state-of-the-art JVM-in-enclave solution) on a set of benchmarks using the BouncyCastle cryptography library.

However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates (traditional) or directly predict potential patches (learning-based). Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly leveraged LLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile, such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art LLMs or was not evaluated on realistic datasets. Thus, the true power of modern LLMs on the important APR problem is yet to be revealed.In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying LLMs for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art LLMs, including both generative and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use LLMs to generate patches: 1) generate the entire patch function, 2) fill in a chunk of code given the prefix and suffix 3) output a single line fix. We apply the LLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3 different languages and compare different LLMs in the number of bugs fixed, generation speed and compilation rate. We also compare the LLMs against recent state-of-the-art APR tools. Our study demonstrates that directly applying state-of-the-art LLMs can already substantially outperform all existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied LLMs, the scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation, the LLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking. Lastly, we show that LLM-based APR can be further substantially boosted via: 1) increasing the sample size, and 2) incorporating fix template information.",False,False,False,True

The proposed approach is built upon the key insight rooted in the unmanaged model uncertainty, which is intrinsic to DNN models, but has not been thoroughly explored especially in the context of quality assurance of DNN models. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective ensemble strategy that estimates and aligns the two models' uncertainty.

To be meaningful to users and developers, the message, i.e., what to say, must be consistent with the condition under which it gets triggered, i.e., when to say it. However, checking for inconsistencies between conditions and messages is challenging because the conditions are expressed in the logic of the programming language, while messages are informally expressed in natural language. This paper presents CMI-Finder, an approach for detecting condition-message inconsistencies. CMI-Finder is based on a neural model that takes a condition and a message as its input and then predicts whether the two are consistent. To address the problem of obtaining realistic, diverse, and large-scale training data, we present six techniques to generate large numbers of inconsistent examples to learn from automatically. Moreover, we describe and compare three neural models, which are based on binary classification, triplet loss, and fine-tuning, respectively.

Due to its important applications, various taint analysis techniques have been proposed, including static and dynamic taint analysis. However, existing taint analysis techniques can be hardly applied to the rising microservice systems for industrial applications. To address such a problem, in this paper, we proposed the first practical non-intrusive dynamic taint analysis technique MirrorTaint for extensively supporting microservice systems on JVMs. In particular, by instrumenting the microservice systems, MirrorTaint constructs a set of data structures with their respective policies for labeling/propagating taints in its mirrored space. Such data structures are essentially non-intrusive, i.e., modifying no program meta-data or runtime system. Then, during program execution, MirrorTaint replicates the stack-based JVM instruction execution in its mirrored space on-the-fly for dynamic taint tracking. We have evaluated MirrorTaint against state-of-the-art dynamic and static taint analysis systems on various popular open-source microservice systems. The results demonstrate that MirrorTaint can achieve better compatibility, quite close precision and higher recall (97.9%/100.0%) than state-of-the-art Phosphor (100.0%/9.9%) and FlowDroid (100%/28.2%).

Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source repositories due to issues was about 28% of the corresponding project test suite size. Meanwhile, due to the difficulties of transforming the expected program semantics in bug reports into test oracles, existing failure reproduction techniques tend to deal exclusively with program crashes, a small subset of all bug reports. To automate test generation from general bug reports, we propose LIBRO, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been shown to be capable of performing code-related tasks. Since LLMs themselves cannot execute the target buggy code, we focus on post-processing steps that help us discern when LLMs are effective, and rank the produced tests according to their validity. Our evaluation of LIBRO shows that, on the widely studied Defects4J benchmark, LIBRO can generate failure reproducing test cases for 33% of all studied cases (251 out of 750), while suggesting a bug reproducing test in first place for 149 bugs. To mitigate data contamination (i.e., the possibility of the LLM simply remembering the test code either partially or in whole), we also evaluate LIBRO against 31 bug reports submitted after the collection of the LLM training data terminated: LIBRO produces bug reproducing tests for 32% of the studied bug reports.

While the existing search based software testing approaches have been effective in discovering fairness defects, they do not supplement these defects with debugging aids---such as severity and causal explanations---crucial to help developers triage and decide on the next course of action. Can we measure the severity of fairness defects in DNNs? Are these defects symptomatic of improper training or they merely reflect biases present in the training data? To answer such questions, we present DICE: an information-theoretic testing and debugging framework to discover and localize fairness defects in DNNs.The key goal of DICE is to assist software developers in triaging fairness defects by ordering them by their severity. Towards this goal, we quantify fairness in terms of protected information (in bits) used in decision making. A quantitative view of fairness defects not only helps in ordering these defects, our empirical evaluation shows that it improves the search efficiency due to resulting smoothness of the search space.

In this paper, we propose SDA-Trans, a syntax and domain-aware model for program translation, which leverages the syntax structure and domain knowledge to enhance the cross-lingual transfer ability. SDA-Trans adopts unsupervised training on a smaller-scale corpus, including Python and Java monolingual programs. The experimental results on function translation tasks between Python, Java, and C++ show that SDA-Trans outperforms many large-scale pre-trained models, especially for unseen language translation.",False,False,False,True
FS,True,Explaining Software Bugs Leveraging Code Structures in Neural Machine Translation,"Mahbub, Parvez, Shuvo, Ohiduzzaman, Rahman, Mohammad Masudur",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00063,"Software bugs claim ≈ 50% of development time and cost the global economy billions of dollars. Once a bug is reported, the assigned developer attempts to identify and understand the source code responsible for the bug and then corrects the code. Over the last five decades, there has been significant research on automatically finding or correcting software bugs. However, there has been little research on automatically explaining the bugs to the developers, which is essential but a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose Bugsplainer, a transformer-based generative model, that generates natural language explanations for software bugs by learning from a large corpus of bug-fix commits. Bugsplainer can leverage structural information and buggy patterns from the source code to generate an explanation for a bug. Our evaluation using three performance metrics shows that Bugsplainer can generate understandable and good explanations according to Google's standard, and can outperform multiple baselines from the literature. We also conduct a developer study involving 20 participants where the explanations from Bugsplainer were found to be more accurate, more precise, more concise and more useful than the baselines.",True,False,False,True
FS,True,CrossCodeBench: Benchmarking Cross-Task Generalization of Source Code Models,"Niu, Changan, Li, Chuanyi, Ng, Vincent, Luo, Bin",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00055,"Despite the recent advances showing that a model pre-trained on large-scale source code data is able to gain appreciable generalization capability, it still requires a sizeable amount of data on the target task for fine-tuning. And the effectiveness of the model generalization is largely affected by the size and quality of the fine-tuning data, which is detrimental for target tasks with limited or unavailable resources. Therefore, cross-task generalization, with the goal of improving the generalization of the model to unseen tasks that have not been seen before, is of strong research and application value.In this paper, we propose a large-scale benchmark that includes 216 existing code-related tasks. Then, we annotate each task with the corresponding meta information such as task description and instruction, which contains detailed information about the task and a solution guide. This also helps us to easily create a wide variety of ""training/evaluation"" task splits to evaluate the various cross-task generalization capabilities of the model. Then we perform some preliminary experiments to demonstrate that the cross-task generalization of models can be largely improved by in-context learning methods such as few-shot learning and learning from task instructions, which shows the promising prospects of conducting cross-task learning research on our benchmark. We hope that the collection of the datasets and our benchmark will facilitate future work that is not limited to cross-task generalization.",False,False,False,True
FS,False,CoLeFunDa: Explainable Silent Vulnerability Fix Identification,"Zhou, Jiayuan, Pacheco, Michael, Chen, Jinfu, Hu, Xing, Xia, Xin, Lo, David, Hassan, Ahmed E.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00214,"It is common practice for OSS users to leverage and monitor security advisories to discover newly disclosed OSS vulnerabilities and their corresponding patches for vulnerability remediation. It is common for vulnerability fixes to be publicly available one week earlier than their disclosure. This gap in time provides an opportunity for attackers to exploit the vulnerability. Hence, OSS users need to sense the fix as early as possible so that the vulnerability can be remediated before it is exploited. However, it is common for OSS to adopt a vulnerability disclosure policy which causes the majority of vulnerabilities to be fixed silently, meaning the commit with the fix does not indicate any vulnerability information. In this case even if a fix is identified, it is hard for OSS users to understand the vulnerability and evaluate its potential impact. To improve early sensing of vulnerabilities, the identification of silent fixes and their corresponding explanations (e.g., the corresponding common weakness enumeration (CWE) and exploitability rating) are equally important.However, it is challenging to identify silent fixes and provide explanations due to the limited and diverse data. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoLeFunDa: a framework consisting of a Contrastive Learner and FunDa, which is a novel approach for Function change Data augmentation. FunDa first increases the fix data (i.e., code changes) at the function level with unsupervised and supervised strategies. Then the contrastive learner leverages contrastive learning to effectively train a function change encoder, FCBERT, from diverse fix data. Finally, we leverage FCBERT to further fine-tune three downstream tasks, i.e., silent fix identification, CWE category classification, and exploitability rating classification, respectively. Our result shows that CoLeFunDa outperforms all the state-of-art baselines in all downstream tasks. We also conduct a survey to verify the effectiveness of CoLeFunDa in practical usage. The result shows that CoLeFunDa can categorize 62.5% (25 out of 40) CVEs with correct CWE categories within the top 2 recommendations.",False,False,False,True

In few-shot learning, these models take as input a prompt, composed of natural language instructions, a few instances of task demonstration, and a query and generate an output. However, the creation of an effective prompt for code-related tasks in few-shot learning has received little attention. We present a technique for prompt creation that automatically retrieves code demonstrations similar to the developer task, based on embedding or frequency analysis. We apply our approach, CEDAR, to two different programming languages, statically and dynamically typed, and two different tasks, namely, test assertion generation and program repair. For each task, we compare CEDAR with state-of-the-art task-specific and fine-tuned models. The empirical results show that, with only a few relevant code demonstrations, our prompt creation technique is effective in both tasks with an accuracy of 76% and 52% for exact matches in test assertion generation and program repair tasks, respectively. For assertion generation, CEDAR outperforms existing task-specific and fine-tuned models by 333% and 11%, respectively. For program repair, CEDAR yields 189% better accuracy than task-specific models and is competitive with recent fine-tuned models. These findings have practical implications for practitioners, as CEDAR could potentially be applied to multilingual and multitask settings without task or language-specific training with minimal examples and effort.",False,False,False,True

Recent program analyses build on the insight that source code can be modelled using techniques from natural language processing. Many of the regularities of source code that support this approach are due to the syntactic overhead imposed by textual programming languages. This syntactic overhead, however, is precisely what block-based languages remove in order to simplify programming. Consequently, it is unclear how well this modelling approach performs on block-based programming languages. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of language models for the popular block-based programming language SCRATCH. We model SCRATCH programs using n-gram models, the most essential type of language model, and transformers, a popular deep learning model. Evaluation on the example tasks of code completion and bug finding confirm that blocks inhibit predictability, but the use of language models is nevertheless feasible. Our findings serve as foundation for improving tooling and analyses for block-based languages.",False,False,False,True

While its flexibility significantly improves software development productivity, the dynamic typing feature challenges software maintenance and quality assurance. To facilitate programming and type error checking, the Python programming language has provided a type hint mechanism enabling developers to annotate type information for variables. However, this manual annotation process often requires plenty of resources and may introduce errors.In this paper, we propose a deep learning type inference technique, namely DLInfer, to automatically infer the type information for Python programs. DLInfer collects slice statements for variables through static analysis and then vectorizes them with the Unigram Language Model algorithm. Based on the vectorized slicing features, we designed a bi-directional gated recurrent unit model to learn the type propagation information for inference. To validate the effectiveness of DLInfer, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 700 open-source projects. We evaluate its accuracy in inferring three kinds of fundamental types, including built-in, library, and user-defined types. By training with a large-scale dataset, DLInfer achieves an average of 98.79% Top-1 accuracy for the variables that can get type information through static analysis and manual annotation. Further, DLInfer achieves 83.03% type inference accuracy on average for the variables that can only obtain the type information through dynamic analysis. The results indicate DLInfer is highly effective in inferring types. It is promising to apply it to assist in various software engineering tasks for Python programs.",True,False,True,True

Real-world programs define large namespaces of variables that considerably contributes to the search space explosion. Existing program repair approaches neglect information about the program namespace, which makes them inefficient and increases the chance of test-overfitting. We propose Rete, a new program repair technique, that learns project-independent information about program namespace and uses it to navigate the search space of patches. Rete uses a neural network to extract project-independent information about variable CDU chains, defuse chains augmented with control flow. Then, it ranks patches by jointly ranking variables and the patch templates into which the variables are inserted. We evaluated Rete on 142 bugs extracted from two datasets, ManyBugs and BugsInPy. Our experiments demonstrate that Rete generates six new correct patches that fix bugs that previous tools did not repair, an improvement of 31% and 59% over the existing state of the art.",False,False,False,True

Diverse Test Input Generators (TIGs) have been proposed to produce artificial inputs that expose issues of the DL systems by triggering misbehaviours. Unfortunately, such generated inputs may be invalid, i.e., not recognisable as part of the input domain, thus providing an unreliable quality assessment. Automated validators can ease the burden of manually checking the validity of inputs for human testers, although input validity is a concept difficult to formalise and, thus, automate.In this paper, we investigate to what extent TIGs can generate valid inputs, according to both automated and human validators. We conduct a large empirical study, involving 2 different automated validators, 220 human assessors, 5 different TIGs and 3 classification tasks. Our results show that 84% artificially generated inputs are valid, according to automated validators, but their expected label is not always preserved. Automated validators reach a good consensus with humans (78% accuracy), but still have limitations when dealing with feature-rich datasets.",False,False,False,True
