MH,,Show Me Your Code! Kill Code Poisoning: A Lightweight Method Based on Code Naturalness,"Sun, Weisong, Chen, Yuchen, Yuan, Mengzhe, Fang, Chunrong, Chen, Zhenpeng, Wang, Chong, Liu, Yang, Xu, Baowen, Chen, Zhenyu",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00247,"Neural code models (NCMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in code intelligence tasks. Meanwhile, the security of NCMs and NCMs-based systems has garnered increasing attention. In particular, NCMs are often trained on large-scale data from potentially untrustworthy sources, providing attackers with the opportunity to manipulate them by inserting crafted samples into the data. This type of attack is called a code poisoning attack (also known as a backdoor attack). It allows attackers to implant backdoors in NCMs and thus control model behavior, which poses a significant security threat. However, there is still a lack of effective techniques for detecting various complex code poisoning attacks.In this paper, we propose an innovative and lightweight technique for code poisoning detection named KillBadCode. KillBadCode is designed based on our insight that code poisoning disrupts the naturalness of code. Specifically, KillBadCode first builds a code language model (CodeLM) on a lightweight n-gram language model. Then, given poisoned data, KillBadCode utilizes CodeLM to identify those tokens in (poisoned) code snippets that will make the code snippets more natural after being deleted as trigger tokens. Considering that the removal of some normal tokens in a single sample might also enhance code naturalness, leading to a high false positive rate (FPR), we aggregate the cumulative improvement of each token across all samples. Finally, KillBadCode purifies the poisoned data by removing all poisoned samples containing the identified trigger tokens. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of KillBadCode, involving two types of advanced code poisoning attacks (a total of five poisoning strategies) and datasets from four representative code intelligence tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that across 20 code poisoning detection scenarios, KillBadCode achieves an average FPR of 8.30% and an average Recall of 100%, significantly outperforming four baselines. More importantly, KillBadCode is very efficient, with a minimum time consumption of only 5 minutes, and is 25 times faster than the best baseline on average.",False,False,False,True

This paper proposes IntUT, a novel approach that utilizes explicit test intentions (e.g., test inputs, mock behaviors, and expected results) to effectively guide the LLM to generate high-quality test cases. Our experimental results on three industry Java projects and live study demonstrate that prompting LLM with test intention can generate high-quality test cases for developers. Specifically, it achieves the improvements on branch coverage by 94% and line coverage by 49%.

MH,,NIODebugger: A Novel Approach to Repair Non-Idempotent-Outcome Tests with LLM-Based Agent,"Ke, Kaiyao",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00226,"Flaky tests, characterized by inconsistent results across repeated executions, present significant challenges in software testing, especially during regression testing. Recently, there has been emerging research interest in non-idempotent-outcome (NIO) flaky tests—tests that pass on the initial run but fail on subsequent executions within the same environment. Despite progress in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to address flaky tests, existing methods have not tackled NIO flaky tests. The limited context window of LLMs restricts their ability to incorporate relevant source code beyond the test method itself, often overlooking crucial information needed to address state pollution, which is the root cause of NIO flakiness.This paper introduces NIODebugger, the first framework to utilize an LLM-based agent to repair flaky tests. NIODebugger features a three-phase design: detection, exploration, and fixing. In the detection phase, dynamic analysis collects stack traces and custom test execution logs from multiple test runs, which helps in understanding accumulative state pollution. During the exploration phase, the LLM-based agent provides instructions for extracting relevant source code associated with test flakiness. In the fixing phase, NIODebugger repairs the tests using the information gathered from the previous phases. NIODebugger can be integrated with multiple LLMs, achieving patching success rates ranging from 11.63% to 58.72%. Its best-performing variant, NIODebugger-GPT-4, successfully generated correct patches for 101 out of 172 previously unknown NIO tests across 20 large-scale open-source projects. We submitted pull requests for all generated patches; 58 have been merged, only 1 was rejected, and the remaining 42 are pending.

MH,,Mock Deep Testing: Toward Separate Development of Data and Models for Deep Learning,"Manke, Ruchira, Wardat, Mohammad, Khomh, Foutse, Rajan, Hridesh",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00220,"While deep learning (DL) has permeated, and become an integral component of many critical software systems, today software engineering research hasn't explored how to separately test data and models that are integral for DL approaches to work effectively. The main challenge in independently testing these components arises from the tight dependency between data and models. This research explores this gap, introducing our methodology of mock deep testing for unit testing of DL applications. To enable unit testing, we introduce a design paradigm that decomposes the workflow into distinct, manageable components, minimizes sequential dependencies, and modularizes key stages of the DL, including data preparation and model design. For unit testing these components, we propose modeling their dependencies using mocks. In the context of DL, mocks refer to mock data and mock model that mimic the behavior of the original data and model, respectively. This modular approach facilitates independent development and testing of the components, ensuring comprehensive quality assurance throughout the development process. We have developed KUnit, a framework for enabling mock deep testing for the Keras library, a popular library for developing DL applications. We empirically evaluated KUnit to determine the effectiveness of mocks in independently testing data and models. Our assessment of 50 DL programs obtained from Stack Overflow and GitHub shows that mocks effectively identified 10 issues in the data preparation stage and 53 issues in the model design stage. We also conducted a user study with 36 participants using KUnit to perceive the effectiveness of our approach. Participants using KUnit successfully resolved 25 issues in the data preparation stage and 38 issues in the model design stage. Our findings highlight that mock objects provide a lightweight emulation of the dependencies for unit testing, facilitating early bug detection. Lastly, to evaluate the usability of KUnit, we conducted a post-study survey. The results reveal that KUnit is helpful to DL application developers, enabling them to independently test each component (data and model) and resolve issues effectively in different stages.",False,False,False,True
MH,,Intention is All You Need: Refining Your Code from Your Intention,"Guo, Qi, Xie, Xiaofei, Liu, Shangqing, Hu, Ming, Li, Xiaohong, Bu, Lei",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00191,"Code refinement aims to enhance existing code by addressing issues, refactoring, and optimizing to improve quality and meet specific requirements. As software projects scale in size and complexity, the traditional iterative exchange between reviewers and developers becomes increasingly burdensome. While recent deep learning techniques have been explored to accelerate this process, their performance remains limited, primarily due to challenges in accurately understanding reviewers' intents.This paper proposes an intention-based code refinement technique that enhances the conventional comment-to-code process by explicitly extracting reviewer intentions from the comments. Our approach consists of two key phases: Intention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation. Intention Extraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention Guided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate revised code based on these defined intentions. Three categories with eight subcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a hybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate classification. Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings demonstrate that our approach achieves 79% accuracy in intention extraction and up to 66% in code refinement generation.

While software engineering traditionally focused on manually created code artifacts with dedicated processes and architectures, ML-enabled systems require additional data-science methods and tools to create ML artifacts—especially ML models and training data. However, integrating models into systems, and managing the many different artifacts involved, is far from trivial. ML-enabled systems can easily have multiple ML models that interact with each other and with traditional code in intricate ways. Unfortunately, while challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems beyond isolated examples. Improving engineering processes and architectures for ML-enabled systems requires improving the empirical understanding of these systems.We present a large-scale study of 2,928 open-source ML-enabled software systems. We classified and analyzed them to determine system characteristics, model and code reuse practices, and architectural aspects of integrating ML models. Our findings show that these systems still mainly consist of traditional source code, and that ML model reuse through code duplication or pre-trained models is common. We also identified different ML integration patterns and related implementation practices. We hope that our results help improve practices for integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.",True,True,True,True
MH,,A Multi-Agent Approach for REST API Testing with Semantic Graphs and LLM-Driven Inputs,"Kim, Myeongsoo, Stennett, Tyler, Sinha, Saurabh, Orso, Alessandro",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00179,"As modern web services increasingly rely on REST APIs, their thorough testing has become crucial. Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation languages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property dependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents—API, dependency, parameter, and value agents—collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest on 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which generates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation study illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest—the SPDG, the LLM, and the agent-learning mechanism—contributes to its overall effectiveness.",False,False,False,True
MH,,Enhancing Code Generation via Bidirectional Comment-Level Mutual Grounding,"Di, Yifeng, Zhang, Tianyi",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00165,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation.

Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach.

Many testing, verification, and bias mitigation techniques have been proposed to identify and reduce fairness issues in ML models. The existing methods are model-centric and designed to detect fairness issues under static settings. However, many ML-enabled systems operate in a dynamic environment where the predictive decisions made by the system impact the environment, which in turn affects future decision-making. Such a self-reinforcing feedback loop can cause fairness violations in the long term, even if the immediate outcomes are fair. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based framework called FairSense to detect and analyze long-term unfairness in ML-enabled systems. Given a fairness requirement, FairSense performs Monte-Carlo simulation to enumerate evolution traces for each system configuration. Then, FairSense performs sensitivity analysis on the space of possible configurations to understand the impact of design options and environmental factors on the long-term fairness of the system.

In Software Engineering, whiteboard sketching is often the initial step before coding, serving as a crucial collaboration tool for developers. Previous studies have investigated patterns in SE sketches and how they are used in practice, yet methods for directly using these sketches for code generation remain limited. The emergence of visually-equipped large language models presents an opportunity to bridge this gap, which is the focus of our research. In this paper, we built a first prototype of a Visual Code Assistant to get user feedback regarding in-IDE sketch-to-code tools. We conduct an experiment with 19 data scientists, most of whom regularly sketch as part of their job. We investigate developers' mental models by analyzing patterns commonly observed in their sketches when developing an ML workflow. Analysis indicates that diagrams were the preferred organizational component (52.6%), often accompanied by lists (42.1%) and numbered points (36.8%). Our tool converts their sketches into a Python notebook by querying an LLM. We use an LLM-as-judge setup to score the quality of the generated code, finding that even brief sketching can effectively generate useful code outlines. We also find a positive correlation between sketch time and the quality of the generated code. We conclude the study by conducting extensive interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, explore potential use cases, and understand developers' needs.

Due to the inherent difficulty of code generation, the code generated by LLMs may not be aligned with the specification. Although thought-eliciting prompting techniques have been proposed to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs, producing correct understanding for complicated programming problems remains challenging, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Also, some feedback-based prompting techniques have been proposed to fix incorrect code using error messages produced by test execution. However, when the generated code deviates significantly from the ground truth, they encounter difficulties in improving performance based on such coarse-grained information.In this work, we propose a novel prompting technique, called μFiX, to improve the code generation performance of LLMs by devising both sophisticated thought-eliciting prompting and feedback-based prompting and making the first exploration on their synergy. It first exploits test case analysis to obtain specification understanding and enables a self-improvement process to identify and refine the misunderstanding in the thought-eliciting prompting phase. μFiX further fixes the specification understanding towards the direction reducing the gap between the provided understanding (from the first phase) and the actual understanding implicitly utilized by LLMs for code generation in the feedback-based prompting phase. By improving the understanding with μFiX, the code generation performance of LLMs can be largely improved. Our evaluation on two advanced LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek-Coder) with six widely-used benchmarks by comparing with 15 baselines, demonstrates the effectiveness of μFiX.

Here, we investigate the effects of interpersonal challenges on the sense of welcomeness among diverse populations within OSS, through the diversity lenses of gender, race, and (dis)ability. We analyzed the large-scale Linux Foundation Diversity and Inclusion survey (n = 706) to model a theoretical framework linking interpersonal challenges with the sense of welcomeness through Structural Equation Models Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM).

To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for ""striking similarity"" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code. Based on this standard, we propose LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs, i.e., the ability to provide accurate license or copyright information when they generate code with striking similarity to already existing copyrighted code. Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations. Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks.

In particular, the integration of LLMs with traditional template-based repair methods has demonstrated effective outcomes. Despite this, the synergy between the strengths of traditional methods and LLMs remains underexploited. This oversight originates from the indiscriminate use of templates and their insufficient coverage. Also, using small-scale LLMs within the zero-shot learning context proves to be suboptimal.To alleviate the limitations, we propose NTR (Neural Template Repair), a two-stage repair framework including template selection and patch generation, both of which are under the fine-tuning paradigm. In the template selection phase, we formulate it as a multiclass classification problem and fine-tune million-level LLMs for better selecting possible templates. During the patch generation phase, we leverage the chosen templates as probable directions (e.g., 'Mutate Conditional Expression') to guide the fine-tuning process of LLMs at the billion-level scale for precise patch creation. Moreover, we incorporate a unique template to signify the absence of a suitable template and employ a probability-based prioritization of templates, thereby optimizing patch generation. This framework not only effectively addresses template mismatch issues, but also enables the billion-level LLMs to explore the patch space more efficiently, despite the GPU memory constraints.We evaluate NTR with different foundational models on Defects4J V1.2 and HumanEval-Java, the framework consistently demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing StarCoder as the foundational model for patch generation, NTR fixes 128 and 129 bugs in Defects4J and HumanEval, outperforming the best baseline APR tool by 14 and 59 bugs. With the larger CodeLlama model, the fixed bugs rise to 139 and 136, respectively, exceeding the baseline by 25 and 66 bugs. Notably, the performance stems not only from the foundational models but also benefits greatly from our NTR framework.

This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique.The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations.

To evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval and ClassEval). Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code LLMs (i.e., predicting code execution behaviors such as program output and execution path), but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient. Typically, they focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the evaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as the logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if the prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely ℛEval, for evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with program execution. We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new benchmarks within our framework. A large-scale empirical study is conducted and most LLMs show unsatisfactory performance on both Runtime Behavior Reasoning (i.e., an average accuracy of 44.4%) and Incremental Consistency Evaluation (i.e., an average IC score of 10.3). Evaluation results of current code LLMs reflect the urgent need for the community to strengthen the code reasoning capability of code LLMs. Our code, data and ℛEval leaderboard are available at https://r-eval.github.io.",False,False,False,True

This long-standing software engineering task is crucial for modernizing legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, enhancing performance, and more. However, automating this process remains challenging due to many syntactic and semantic differences between PLs. Recent studies show that even advanced techniques such as large language models (LLMs), especially open-source LLMs, still struggle with the task.Currently, code LLMs are trained with source code from multiple programming languages, thus presenting multilingual capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed to enhance code translation. To achieve this goal, we introduce InterTrans, an LLM-based automated code translation approach that, in contrast to existing approaches, leverages intermediate translations to bridge the syntactic and semantic gaps between source and target PLs.

Numerous implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms responsible for training these agents, like the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, currently exist. However, studies make the mistake of assuming implementations of the same algorithm to be consistent and thus, interchangeable. In this paper, through a differential testing lens, we present the results of studying the extent of implementation inconsistencies, their effect on the implementations' performance, as well as their impact on the conclusions of prior studies under the assumption of interchangeable implementations. The outcomes of our differential tests showed significant discrepancies between the tested algorithm implementations, indicating that they are not interchangeable. In particular, out of the five PPO implementations tested on 56 games, three implementations achieved superhuman performance for 50% of their total trials while the other two implementations only achieved superhuman performance for less than 15% of their total trials. Furthermore, the performance among the high-performing PPO implementations was found to differ significantly in nine games. As part of a meticulous manual analysis of the implementations' source code, we analyzed implementation discrepancies and determined that code-level inconsistencies primarily caused these discrepancies. Lastly, we replicated a study and showed that this assumption of implementation interchangeability was sufficient to flip experiment outcomes. Therefore, this calls for a shift in how implementations are being used.

Its convenience comes from encapsulating network communication. However, for the same reason, it cannot be penetrated by current static analyzers. Since the RPC based programs/frameworks play a more important role in various domains, the static analysis of RPC is significant and cannot be ignored.We have observed that many of the existing RPC frameworks/programs written in Java are based on explicit protocols, which makes them possible to be modelled for static analysis. The challenges are how to identify RPC operations in different frameworks/programs and how to automatically establish relationships between clients and servers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, RPCBridge, which uses an adapter to unify the most basic operations during the RPC process. It models the RPC with logic rules in a straightforward and precise way based on its semantics, performs points-to analysis and constructs RPC edges in the call graph, making it more complete. The evaluation on real-world large-scale Java programs based on 5 common RPC frameworks shows that our approach can effectively capture the operations of the RPC and construct critical links between clients and servers, in which 60.1% are the true caller-callee pairs after execution.

To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages the exceptional code comprehension capability of large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code. InferROI first prompts the LLM to infer involved intentions for a given code snippet, and then incorporates a two-stage static analysis approach to check control-flow paths for resource leak detection based on the inferred intentions.We evaluate the effectiveness of InferROI in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection.

Therefore, it has become crucial to detect these security patches to ensure secure software maintenance. However, existing methods face the following challenges: (1) They primarily focus on the information within the patches themselves, overlooking the complex dependencies in the repository. (2) Security patches typically involve multiple functions and files, increasing the difficulty in well learning the representations. To alleviate the above challenges, this paper proposes a Repository-level Security Patch Detection framework named RepoSPD, which comprises three key components: 1) a repository-level graph construction, RepoCPG, which represents software patches by merging pre-patch and post-patch source code at the repository level; 2) a structure-aware patch representation, which fuses the graph and sequence branch and aims at comprehending the relationship among multiple code changes; 3) progressive learning, which facilitates the model in balancing semantic and structural information. To evaluate RepoSPD, we employ two widely-used datasets in security patch detection: SPI-DB and PatchDB. We further extend these datasets to the repository level, incorporating a total of 20,238 and 28,781 versions of repository in C/C++ programming languages, respectively, denoted as SPI-DB* and PatchDB*.

To tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). Our intuition is based on the fact that the training corpora of LLMs contain extensive code changes and their pairwise commit messages, which makes LLMs capture the knowledge about commits, while ICL can exploit the knowledge hidden in the LLMs and enable them to perform downstream tasks without model tuning. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs perform on commit message generation via ICL. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the capability of LLMs to generate commit messages via ICL. Specifically, we first explore the impact of different settings on the performance of ICL-based commit message generation. We then compare ICL-based commit message generation with state-of-the-art approaches on a popular multilingual dataset and a new dataset we created to mitigate potential data leakage. The results show that ICL-based commit message generation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on subjective evaluation and achieves better generalization ability.

Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of ""Specialist in Familiarity"", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised.The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark ObfusEval. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies.

However, the vulnerability datasets used to train deep vulnerability detectors frequently exhibit class imbalance due to the inherent nature of vulnerability data, where vulnerable cases are significantly rarer than non-vulnerable cases. This imbalance adversely affects the effectiveness of these detectors. A promising solution to address the class imbalance problem is to artificially generate vulnerable samples to enhance vulnerability datasets, yet existing vulnerability generation techniques are not satisfactory due to their inadequate representation of real-world vulnerabilities or their reliance on large-scale vulnerable samples for training the generation model.This paper proposes GVI, a novel approach aimed at generating vulnerable samples to boost deep vulnerability detectors.

One promising approach to support end-users is to provide hints to help them find and fix bugs while forming and improving their programming capabilities. While it is plausible that hints can help, it is unclear which type of hint is helpful and how this depends on program representations (classic source code or a textual representation) and the user's capability of understanding the algorithmic task. To understand the role of hints in this space, we conduct a large-scale crowd-sourced study involving 753 participants investigating the effect of three types of hints (test cases, conceptual, and detailed), across two program representations (Python and text-based), and two groups of users (with clear understanding or confusion about the algorithmic task).

These artifacts interrelate in multiple, complex ways. Therefore, many software engineering tasks are enabled — and even empowered — by a clear understanding of artifact interrelationships and also by the continued advancement of techniques for automated artifact linking.However, current approaches in automatic Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) target mostly the links between specific sets of artifacts, such as those between requirements and code. Fortunately, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable TLR approaches to achieve broad applicability. Still, it is a nontrivial problem how to provide the LLMs with the specific information needed to perform TLR.In this paper, we present LiSSA, a framework that harnesses LLM performance and enhances them through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We empirically evaluate LiSSA on three different TLR tasks, requirements to code, documentation to code, and architecture documentation to architecture models, and we compare our approach to state-of-the-art approaches.Our results show that the RAG-based approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on the code-related tasks.

However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.",False,False,False,True

Over a period of four years, we built a new authorization engine, one that behaves functionally the same as its predecessor, using the verification-aware programming language Dafny. We can now confidently deploy enhancements and optimizations while maintaining the highest assurance of both correctness and backward compatibility. We deployed the new engine in 2024 without incident and customers immediately enjoyed a threefold performance improvement. The methodology we followed to build this new engine was not an off-the-shelf application of an existing verification tool, and this paper presents several key insights: 1) Rather than prove correct the existing engine, written in Java, we found it more effective to write a new engine in Dafny, a language built for verification from the ground up, and then compile the result to Java. 2) To ensure performance, debuggability, and to gain trust from stakeholders, we needed to generate readable, idiomatic Java code, essentially a transliteration of the source Dafny. 3) To ensure that the specification matches the system's actual behavior, we performed extensive differential and shadow testing throughout the development process, ultimately comparing against 1015 production samples prior to deployment.Our approach demonstrates how formal verification can be effectively applied to evolve critical legacy software at scale.The email addresses of Amazon-affiliated authors end with amazon.com.

Traditional syntax-based log parsers are efficient and effective, but they often experience decreased accuracy when processing logs that deviate from the predefined rules. Recently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superior parsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three main challenges: 1) time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling for fine-tuning or in-context learning, 2) increased parsing costs due to the vast volume of log data and limited context size of LLMs, and 3) privacy risks from using commercial models like ChatGPT with sensitive log information. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces LibreLog, an unsupervised log parsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama3-8B) to enhance privacy and reduce operational costs while achieving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy. LibreLog first groups logs with similar static text but varying dynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. It then parses logs within these groups using three components: i) similarity scoring-based retrieval augmented generation: selects diverse logs within each group based on Jaccard similarity, helping the LLM distinguish between static text and dynamic variables; ii) self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs to refine log templates to improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory: stores parsed templates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency. Our evaluation on LogHub-2.0 shows that LibreLog achieves 25% higher parsing accuracy and processes logs 2.7 times faster compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based parsers. In short, LibreLog addresses privacy and cost concerns of using commercial LLMs while achieving state-of-the-arts parsing efficiency and accuracy.",False,False,False,True

In this paper, we study how we can reduce the community's workload in answering these questions and increase the likelihood that questions receive a quick answer. We analyze 11,278 discussions from the HF model community that contain user questions about ML models. We focus on the effort spent handling questions, the high-level topics of discussions, and the potential for standardizing responses in model cards based on a model card template. Our findings indicate that there is not much effort involved in responding to user questions, however, 40.1% of the questions remain open without any response.

This has caused some configuration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from their original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies, namely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be deeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult, not only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the configuration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible configurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy runtime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is limited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle.In this paper, we seek to achieve significantly faster CP-Bug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing at both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle estimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works with different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural language models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle while, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being CPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched can be prioritized.

While tracking OSS component versions helps mitigate threats, existing approaches typically map a single version to the reused codebase. This coarse-grained approach overlooks the coexistence of multiple versions, leading to ineffective OSS management. Moreover, identifying component versions is further complicated by noise codes, such as shared algorithmic code across different OSS, and duplicate components caused by redundant OSS reuse.In this paper, we introduce the concept of the adaptive version, a one-stop solution to represent the version diversity of reused OSS. To identify adaptive versions, we present Tiver, which employs two key techniques: (1) fine-grained function-level versioning and (2) OSS code clustering to identify duplicate components and remove noise. This enables precise identification of OSS reuse locations and adaptive versions, effectively mitigating risks associated with OSS reuse. Evaluation of 2,025 popular C/C++ software revealed that 67% of OSS components contained multiple versions, averaging over three versions per component.

This problem is particularly pronounced in Rust due to its intricate type system, making traditional unit test generation tools ineffective in Rust projects. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in understanding programming language and completing software engineering tasks. However, merely prompting LLMs with a basic prompt like ""generate unit test for the following source code"" often results in code with compilation errors.

To help LLM's generated test pass Rust strict compilation checks, Rug designs a semantic-aware bottom-up approach to divide the context construction problem into dependent sub-problems. It solves these sub-problems sequentially using an LLM and merges them to a complete context. To increase test coverage, Rug integrates coverage-guided fuzzing with LLM to prepare fuzzing harnesses.

Such program improvement can be accomplished by a combination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in the form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically requires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be useful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine efficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within an LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our goal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference - thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The intent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting the patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches. Our approach SpecRover is built on the open-source LLM agent AutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub issues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover. Compared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65 per issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The production of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better ""signal"" to be given to the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with confidence.

Despite their popularity, DL libraries are known to have vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and integer overflows, that can be exploited to compromise the security or effectiveness of the underlying libraries. While traditional fuzzing techniques have been used to find bugs in software, they are not well-suited for DL libraries. In general, the complexity of DL libraries and the diversity of their APIs make it challenging to test them thoroughly. To date, mainstream DL libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch have featured over 1,000 APIs, and the number of APIs is still growing. Fuzzing all these APIs is a daunting task, especially when considering the complexity of the input data and the diversity of the API usage patterns.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have illustrated the high potential of LLMs in understanding and synthesizing human-like code. Despite their high potential, we find that emerging LLM-based fuzzers are less optimal for DL library API fuzzing, given their lack of in-depth knowledge on API input edge cases and inefficiency in generating test inputs. In this paper, we propose DFuzz, a LLM-driven DL library fuzzing approach. We have two key insights: (1) With high reasoning ability, LLMs can replace human experts to reason edge cases (likely error-triggering inputs) from checks in an API's code, and transfer the extracted knowledge to test other (new or rarely-tested) APIs. (2) With high generation ability, LLMs can synthesize initial test programs with high accuracy that automates API testing. DFUZZ provides LLMs with a novel ""white-box view"" of DL library APIs, and therefore, can leverage LLMs' reasoning and generation abilities to achieve comprehensive fuzzing. Our experimental results on popular DL libraries demonstrate that DFUZZ is able to cover more APIs than SOTA (LLM-based) fuzzers on TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively. Moreover, DFUZZ successfully detected 37 bugs, with 8 already fixed and 19 replicated by the developer but still under investigation.",False,False,False,True

However, existing Wasm testing frameworks fail to generate test cases that effectively test all three phases of runtime, i.e., decoding, validation, and execution. To address this research gap, we propose a new differential testing framework for Wasm runtimes, which leverages knowledge from the Wasm language specification that prior techniques overlooked, enhancing comprehensive testing of runtime functionality. Specifically, we first use a large language model to extract that knowledge from the specification. We use that knowledge in the context of multiple novel mutation operators that generate test cases with diverse features to test all three runtime phases. We evaluate LWDiff by applying it to eight Wasm runtimes. Compared with the state-of-the-art Wasm testers, LWDiff achieves the highest branch coverage and identifies the largest number of bugs.

Incomplete or ambiguous requirements are one of the biggest sources for defects, since stakeholders might not be able to communicate their needs or fail to share their domain specific knowledge. Combined with insufficient developer experience, teams are prone to constructing incorrect or incomplete features. To prevent this, requirements engineering has to explore knowledge sources beyond stakeholder interviews. Publicly accessible issue trackers for systems within the same application domain hold essential information on identified weaknesses, edge cases, and potential error sources, all documented by actual users. Our research aims at (1) identifying, and (2) leveraging such issues to improve an agile requirements artifact known as a ""user story"". We present CrUISE-AC (Crowd and User Informed Suggestion Engine for Acceptance Criteria) as a fully automated method that investigates issues and generates non-trivial additional acceptance criteria for a given user story by employing NLP techniques and an ensemble of LLMs. CrUISE-AC was evaluated by five independent experts in two distinct business domains. Our findings suggest that issue trackers hold valuable information pertinent to requirements engineering.

Nevertheless, despite efforts from academia and industry, CSP policies (in short, CSPs) are not widely deployed on websites, and deployed CSPs often have security issues or errors. Such low and insecure CSP deployment problems are mainly due to the complexity of the CSP mechanism. Google recently proposed four nonce-based CSP solutions which are simpler and more secure compared to traditional whitelisting-based CSP solutions. Google successfully deployed their nonce-based CSP solutions on over 160 services, covering 62% of all outgoing Google traffic. These nonce-based CSP solutions use simple CSPs but provide fine-grained control of web resources; therefore, if widely adopted on many other websites, they can be very helpful on addressing the low and insecure CSP deployment problems. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of adopting Google's nonce-based CSP solutions on the Tranco top 10K websites. We construct a crawling tool to automatically visit websites, simulate user interactions, and insert four CSPs to collect the CSP violations triggered under them. We investigate the adoptability of the nonce-based CSP solutions, adoption issues, and the stability of adopting them on websites by analyzing the CSP violations triggered under the inserted CSPs. We found that most websites can adopt the nonce-based CSP solutions on all their webpages visited in our study. For websites that cannot, usually the adoption is hard on around 40% of their webpages. Overall, our results are very encouraging and can be helpful in promoting the proper deployment of CSPs on many websites.",True,False,False,True

Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs? To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark. Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial. Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it. Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance. We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair. Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt. This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set. To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked MANIPLE against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.

This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable of autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitable tools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug, gathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which tools to invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fix attempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools that are useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allows the LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guides the agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4J dataset demonstrates RepairAgent's effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164 bugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLM imposes an average cost of 270k tokens per bug, which, under the current pricing of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents per bug.

The substantial value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes it a lucrative target for attacks. Despite the human resources and the application of automated tools, frequent attacks still cause significant fund losses to DeFi participants. Existing tools primarily rely on oracles similar to those used in traditional software analysis, making it challenging for them to detect functional bugs specific to the DeFi domain. Since blockchain functions as a distributed ledger system, the foundation of any DeFi protocol is the accurate maintenance of key state variables representing user funds. If these variables are not properly updated or designed to reflect the intended flow of funds, attackers can exploit these flaws to steal assets. From the study of popular DeFi protocols, we observe that, in DeFi systems, to ensure a transaction does not misappropriate someone's fund, the direction of changes (increase or decrease) of values associated with the amount of asset or debt of a user has to adhere to some fairness properties. We propose a concept called fairness bug which allows attackers to gain profit without cost.

PDBs can result in significant consequences from decreased system efficiency and prolonged query processing times to potential disruptions in critical business operations.In this paper, we present Puppy, an automated approach for detecting PDBs in DBMSs using limited-optimization plan construction. The key idea is to compare the performance with the plan generated with all optimization operations enabled, against the plan generated with only a subset of optimization operations in the same DBMS. If the response time of the plan with the limited optimization set is shorter than that of the fully optimized plan, it indicates a potential PDB. Specifically, Puppy first generates queries that incorporate multiple optimization sequences, guided by optimization operation sequence coverage. Secondly, Puppy analyzes the query plan and selectively disables specific optimizations to construct the limited optimization plan.

Users would benefit from a reliable indication of whether a given output from a given model should be trusted, so a rational decision can be made whether to use the output or not. For example, outputs can be associated with a confidence measure; if this confidence measure is strongly associated with likelihood of correctness, then the model is said to be well-calibrated.A well-calibrated confidence measure can serve as a basis for rational, graduated decision-making on how much review and care is needed when using generated code. Calibration has so far been studied in mostly non-generative (e.g., classification) settings, especially in software engineering. However, generated code can quite often be wrong: Given generated code, developers must decide whether to use directly, use after varying intensity of careful review, or discard model-generated code. Thus, calibration is vital in generative settings.We make several contributions. We develop a framework for evaluating the calibration of code-generating models. We consider several tasks, correctness criteria, datasets, and approaches, and find that, by and large, generative code models we test are not well-calibrated out of the box. We then show how calibration can be improved using standard methods, such as Platt scaling. Since Platt scaling relies on the prior availability of correctness data, we evaluate the applicability and generalizability of Platt scaling in software engineering, discuss settings where it has good potential for practical use, and settings where it does not.

Additionally, the evaluation methods used with these datasets are not representative of real-world vulnerability detection.To address these challenges, we introduce PrimeVul, a new dataset for training and evaluating code LMs for vulnerability detection.

This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.In this paper, we propose iAudit, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, iAudit is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, iAudit employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate iAudit, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune iAudit.

Approaches based on deep learning techniques have been increasingly adopted for this task, enhancing the initial representations of both code and its natural language descriptions. Despite this progress, there remains an unexplored gap in ensuring consistency between the representation spaces of code and its descriptions. Furthermore, existing methods have not fully leveraged the potential relevance between code snippets and their descriptions, presenting a challenge in discerning fine-grained semantic distinctions among similar code snippets.To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-task hedging contrastive Learning framework for Code Search, referred to as HedgeCode. HedgeCode is structured around two primary training phases. The first phase, known as the representation alignment stage, proposes a hedging contrastive learning approach. This method aims to detect subtle differences between code and natural language text, thereby aligning their representation spaces by identifying relevance. The subsequent phase involves multi-task joint learning, wherein the previously trained model serves as the encoder. This stage optimizes the model through a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning tasks.

Consequently, automated and semi-automated tool support is highly desirable for software refactoring in the industry, and most of the main-stream IDEs provide powerful tool support for refactoring. However, complex refactoring engines are prone to errors, which in turn may result in imperfect and incorrect refactorings. To this end, in this paper, we propose a ChatGPT-based approach to testing refactoring engines. We first manually analyze bug reports and test cases associated with refactoring engines, and construct a feature library containing fine-grained features that may trigger defects in refactoring engines. The approach automatically generates prompts according to both predefined prompt templates and features randomly selected from the feature library, requesting ChatGPT to generate test programs with the requested features.

However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are susceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is produced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned on it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based approaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to the challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of resources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time during code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait for post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose RoCode, which integrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code generation. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental error detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the backtracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and constraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring continued generation on the correct basis. Experiments on multiple code generation benchmarks show that RoCode can significantly reduce the errors generated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%. The test pass rate is relatively improved by up to 23.8% compared to the best baseline approach. Compared to the post-revising baseline, the token cost is reduced by 19.3%.

In Orca, we guide the LLM to pause at the branching point, focusing on the state of the symbol tables for variables' values, thus minimizing error propagation in the LLM's computation. We instruct the LLM not to stop at each step in its execution plan, resulting the use of only one prompt for the entire predictive interpreter, thus much cost-saving.

Therefore, effectively resolving the interactions between Java and native code is crucial for static analysis. In this paper, we introduce JNIFER, the first interactive cross-language pointer analysis for resolving native code in Java programs. JNIFER integrates both Java and C pointer analyses, equipped with advanced native call and JNI function analyses, enabling the simultaneous analysis of both Java and native code. During the analysis of cross-language interactions, the two analyzers interact with each other, constructing cross-language points-to relations and call graphs, thereby approximating the runtime behavior at the interaction sites.

Existing approaches mainly rely on retrieval-augmented generation strategies due to limitations in input sequence length. However, traditional lexical-based retrieval methods like BM25 struggle to capture code semantics, while model-based retrieval methods face challenges due to the lack of labeled data for training. Therefore, we propose RLCoder, a novel reinforcement learning framework, which can enable the retriever to learn to retrieve useful content for code completion without the need for labeled data. Specifically, we iteratively evaluate the usefulness of retrieved content based on the perplexity of the target code when provided with the retrieved content as additional context, and provide feedback to update the retriever parameters. This iterative process enables the retriever to learn from its successes and failures, gradually improving its ability to retrieve relevant and high-quality content. Considering that not all situations require information beyond code files and not all retrieved context is helpful for generation, we also introduce a stop signal mechanism, allowing the retriever to decide when to retrieve and which candidates to retain autonomously. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RLCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval, achieving 12.2% EM improvement over previous methods.

However, as we demonstrate in this study, compressed models are four times less robust than the original LLMs when evaluated with metamorphic code. They exhibit a 440% higher probability of misclassifying code clones due to minor changes in the code fragment under analysis, such as replacing parameter names with synonyms. To address this issue, we propose Morph, a novel method that combines metamorphic testing with many-objective optimization for a robust distillation of LLMs for code. Morph efficiently explores the models' configuration space and generates Pareto-optimal models that effectively balance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness to metamorphic code. Metamorphic testing measures robustness as the number of code fragments for which a model incorrectly makes different predictions between the original and their equivalent metamorphic variants (prediction flips). We evaluate Morph on two tasks—code clone and vulnerability detection—targeting CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT for distillation. Our comparison includes Morph, the state-of-the-art distillation method Avatar, and the fine-tuned non-distilled LLMs. Compared to Avatar, Morph produces compressed models that are (i) 47% more robust, (ii) 25% more efficient (fewer floating-point operations), while maintaining (iii) equal or higher accuracy (up to +6%), and (iv) similar model size.",True,True,True,True

Two major modalities exist that serve as the source information in the analysis: either the manual or source code.

No interventions for improving social sustainability in software engineering have been tested in rigorous lab-based experiments, and little evidence-based guidance is available. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions—stakeholder maps and persona models—for improving social sustainability through software feature prioritization. Method: We conducted a randomized controlled factorial experiment with 79 undergraduate computer science students. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups and asked to prioritize a backlog of prosocial, neutral, and antisocial user stories for a shopping mall's digital screen display and facial recognition software. Participants received either persona models, a stakeholder map, both, or neither. We compared the differences in prioritization levels assigned to prosocial and antisocial user stories using Cumulative Link Mixed Model regression. Results: Participants who received persona models gave significantly lower priorities to antisocial user stories but no significant difference was evident for prosocial user stories. The effects of the stakeholder map were not significant. The interaction effects were not significant. Conclusion: Providing aspiring software professionals with well-crafted persona models causes them to de-prioritize antisocial software features. The impact of persona modelling on sustainable software development therefore warrants further study with more experience professionals.

Due to their complexity, manual testing is unlikely to suffice, yet formal verification is difficult to scale. End-to-end fuzzing can be used, but it has difficulties in discovering LLVM backend problems for two reasons. First, frontend preprocessing and middle optimization shield the backend from seeing diverse inputs. Second, branch coverage cannot provide effective feedback as LLVM backend contains much reusable code.In this paper, we implement IRFuzzer to investigate the need of specialized fuzzing of the LLVM compiler backend. We focus on two approaches to improve the fuzzer: guaranteed input validity using constrained mutations to improve input diversity and new metrics to improve feedback quality. The mutator in IRFuzzer can generate a wide range of LLVM IR inputs, including structured control flow, vector types, and function definitions. The system instruments coding patterns in the compiler to monitor the execution status of instruction selection. The instrumentation not only provides new coverage feedback on the matcher table but also guides the mutator on architecture-specific intrinsics.We ran IRFuzzer on 29 mature LLVM backend targets. IRFuzzer discovered 78 new, confirmed bugs in LLVM upstream, none of which existing fuzzers could discover. This demonstrates that IRFuzzer is far more effective than existing fuzzers.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have confirmed their effectiveness in the code generation task with promising results. However, their performance on code snippet adaptation, a reuse-oriented and context-dependent code change prediction task, is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance and issues of LLMs on the adaptation task. We first evaluate the adaptation performances of three popular LLMs and compare them to the code generation task. Our result indicates that their adaptation ability is weaker than generation, with a nearly 15% decrease on pass@1 and more context-related errors. By manually inspecting 200 cases, we further investigate the causes of LLMs' sub-optimal performance, which can be classified into three categories, i.e., Unclear Requirement, Requirement Misalignment and Context Misapplication. Based on the above empirical research, we propose an interactive prompting approach to eliciting LLMs' ability on the adaptation task. Specifically, we enhance the prompt by enriching the context and decomposing the task, which alleviates context misapplication and improves requirement understanding. Besides, we enable LLMs' reflection by requiring them to interact with a human or a LLM counselor, compensating for unclear requirement. Our experimental result reveals that our approach greatly improve LLMs' adaptation performance. The best-performing Human-LLM interaction successfully solves 159 out of the 202 identified defects and improves the pass@1 and pass@5 by over 40% compared to the initial instruction-based prompt.

As RL software becomes more complex and infiltrates critical application domains, ensuring its quality and correctness becomes increasingly important. An indispensable aspect of software quality/correctness insurance is testing. However, testing RL software faces unique challenges compared to testing traditional software, due to the difficulty on defining the outputs' correctness. This leads to the RL test oracle problem. Current approaches to testing RL software often rely on human oracles, i.e. convening human experts to judge the correctness of RL software outputs. This heavily depends on the availability and quality (including the experiences, subjective states, etc.) of the human experts, and cannot be fully automated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to design test oracles for RL software by leveraging the Lyapunov stability control theory. By incorporating Lyapunov stability concepts to guide RL training, we hypothesize that a correctly implemented RL software shall output an agent that respects Lyapunov stability control theories. Based on this heuristics, we propose a Lyapunov stability control theory based oracle, LPEA(ϑ, θ), for testing RL software.

This criterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for individuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing tools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a randomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points from the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a sufficient number of relevant samples.We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from the literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI methods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT distribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias mitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case discrimination significantly in 35% of cases.

Different from ordinary firmware, the monolithic firmware image is packed without the file that indicates its format, which challenges the reverse engineering of monolithic firmware. Function identification is the prerequisite of monolithic firmware's analysis. Prior works on function identification are less effectiveness when applied to monolithic firmware due to their heavy reliance on file formats. In this paper, we propose Moye, a novel method to identify functions in monolithic firmware. We leverage the important insight that the use of registers must conform to some constraints. In particular, our approach segments the firmware, locate code sections and output the instructions. We use a masked language model to learn hiding relationships among the instructions to identify the function boundaries. We evaluate Moye using 1,318 monolithic firmware images, including 48 samples collected from widely used devices.

However, user testing is not popular with software developers as it requires conducting lengthy interviews with users and later parsing through large recordings to derive the issues to fix. In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) like GPT 4.0, which have shown promising results in context comprehension and semantic text generation, can mitigate this issue and streamline the user testing process.

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of code-related tasks. In this paper, we undertake a systematic and comprehensive study on code summarization in the era of LLMs, which covers multiple aspects involved in the workflow of LLM-based code summarization. Specifically, we begin by examining prevalent automated evaluation methods for assessing the quality of summaries generated by LLMs and find that the results of the GPT-4 evaluation method are most closely aligned with human evaluation. Then, we explore the effectiveness of five prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, critique, and expert) in adapting LLMs to code summarization tasks. Contrary to expectations, advanced prompting techniques may not outperform simple zero-shot prompting. Next, we investigate the impact of LLMs' model settings (including top_p and temperature parameters) on the quality of generated summaries. We find the impact of the two parameters on summary quality varies by the base LLM and programming language, but their impacts are similar. Moreover, we canvass LLMs' abilities to summarize code snippets in distinct types of programming languages. The results reveal that LLMs perform suboptimally when summarizing code written in logic programming languages compared to other language types (e.g., procedural and object-oriented programming languages).

These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code.To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods. Our evaluation of SBLLM on a dataset of Python and C++ code demonstrates its effectiveness in improving code efficiency. Specifically, the results indicate that SBLLM can improve program execution efficiency by up to 209.59% and consistently outperform all baseline methods by 8.75% ~ 28.06% and 1.15% ~ 9.56% with different LLMs in terms of top-5 speedup rate on Python and C++, respectively.",False,False,False,True

Commit classification plays a vital role in both industry and academia. The widely-used commit classification framework was proposed in 1976 by Swanson and includes three base classes: perfective, corrective, and adaptive. With the increasing complexity of software development, the industry has shifted towards a more fine-grained commit category, i.e., adopting Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) for delicacy management. The new commit framework requires developers to classify commits into ten distinct categories, such as ""feat"", ""fix"", and ""docs"". However, existing studies mainly focus on the three-category classification, leaving the definition and application of the fine-grained commit categories as knowledge gaps. This paper reports a preliminary study on this mechanism from its application status and problems. We also explore ways to address these identified problems. We find that a growing number of projects on GitHub are adopting CCS. By qualitatively analyzing 194 issues from GitHub and 100 questions from Stack Overflow about the CCS application, we categorized four main challenges developers encountered when using CCS. The most common one is CCS-type confusion. To address these challenges, we propose a clear definition of CCS types based on existing variants. Further, we designed an approach to automatically classify commits into CCS types, and the evaluation results demonstrate a promising performance.

Existing methods have made significant and commendable efforts in testing individual discrimination before deployment. However, their efficiency and effectiveness remain limited, particularly when evaluating relatively fairer models. It remains unclear which phase of the existing testing framework (global or local) is the primary bottleneck limiting performance.Facing the above issues, we first identify that enhancing the global phase consistently improves overall testing effectiveness compared to enhancing the local phase.

Although LLMs are powerful in various code generation tasks, it is shown to be ineffective in generating symbolic models (according to our empirical study). Therefore, rather than applying LLMs naively, we carefully decompose the symbolic protocol modeling task into several stages so that a series of formal models are incrementally developed towards generating the final correct symbolic model. Specifically, we apply LLMs for semantic parsing, enable lightweight manual interaction for disambiguation, and develop algorithms to transform the intermediate models for final symbolic model generation. To ensure the correctness of the generated symbolic model, each stage is designed based on a formal execution model and the model transformations are proven sound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to generate symbolic models for protocol verification from natural language documents. We also introduce a benchmark for symbolic protocol model generation, with 18 real-world security protocol's text description and their corresponding symbolic models.

By conducting a large-scale experiment involving two human experts, who thoroughly explored 61 benchmark and 42 popular apps from Google Play, we show that achieving a substantially larger coverage for real-world applications is impractical even if we factor out known GUI-based exploration issues, such as the inability to provide semantic inputs and the right order of events. The main reasons preventing even human analysts from covering the entire application include application dependencies on remote servers and external resources, hard-to-reach app entry points, disabled and erroneous features, and software/hardware properties of the underlying device. Thus, future investment in GUI-based exploration strategies is unlikely to lead to substantial improvements in coverage. To chart possible ways forward and explore approaches to satisfy/bypass these ""blockers"", we thoroughly analyze code-level properties guarding them.

To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a scenario-driven exploration method for improving the coverage of UI scenarios, thereby detecting accessibility issues within the application, and ultimately reducing false negatives. Furthermore, to reduce false positives caused by not considering the runtime context, we propose a context-aware detection method that provides a more fine-grained detection capability.Our experimental results reveal that A11yScan can detect 1.7X more issues surpassing current state-of-the-art approaches like Xbot (3,991 vs. 2,321), thereby reducing the false negative rate by 41.84%. Additionally, it outperforms established UI exploration techniques such as SceneDroid (952 vs. 661 UI scenarios), while achieving comparable activity coverage to recent leading GUI testing tools like GPTDroid on the available dataset (73% vs. 71%). Meanwhile, with the context-aware detection method, A11yScan effectively reduces the false positive rate by 21%, validated with a 90.56% accuracy rate through a user study.",False,False,False,True
MH,,Revisiting Unnaturalness for Automated Program Repair in the Era of Large Language Models,"Yang, Aidan Z. H., Kolak, Sophia, Hellendoorn, Vincent, Martins, Ruben, Goues, Claire Le",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00089,"The problem of software quality has motivated the development of a variety of techniques for Automatic Program Repair (APR). Meanwhile, recent advances in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have produced orders of magnitude performance improvements over previous code generation techniques, affording promising opportunities for program repair and its constituent subproblems (e.g., fault localization, patch generation). Because models are trained on large volumes of code in which defects are relatively rare, they tend to both simultaneously perceive faulty code as unlikely (or ""unnatural"") and to produce generally correct code (which is more ""natural""). This paper comprehensively revisits the idea of (un)naturalness for program repair. We argue that, fundamentally, LLMs can only go so far on their own in reasoning about and fixing buggy code. This motivates the incorporation of traditional tools, which compress useful contextual and analysis information, as a complement to LLMs for repair. We interrogate the role of entropy at every stage of traditional repair, and show that it is indeed usefully complementary to classic techniques. We show that combining measures of naturalness with class Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) approaches improves Top-5 scoring by 50% over SBFL alone. We show that entropy delta, or change in entropy induced by a candidate patch, can improve patch generation efficiency by 24 test suite executions per repair, on average, on our dataset. Finally, we show compelling results that entropy delta for patch classification is highly effective at distinguishing correct from overfitting patches. Overall, our results suggest that LLMs can effectively complement classic techniques for analysis and transformation, producing more efficient and effective automated repair techniques overall.",True,False,False,True
MH,,PairSmell: A Novel Perspective Inspecting Software Modular Structure,"Zhong, Chenxing, Feitosa, Daniel, Avgeriou, Paris, Huang, Huang, Li, Yue, Zhang, He",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00072,"Enhancing the modular structure of existing systems has attracted substantial research interest, focusing on two main methods: (1) software modularization and (2) identifying design issues (e.g., smells) as refactoring opportunities. However, re-modularization solutions often require extensive modifications to the original modules, and the design issues identified are generally too coarse to guide refactoring strategies. Combining the above two methods, this paper introduces a novel concept, PairSmell, which exploits modularization to pinpoint design issues necessitating refactoring. We concentrate on a granular but fundamental aspect of modularity principles—modular relation (MR), i.e., whether a pair of entities are separated or collocated. The main assumption is that, if the actual MR of a pair violates its 'apt MR', i.e., an MR agreed on by multiple modularization tools (as raters), it can be deemed likely a flawed architectural decision that necessitates further examination.To quantify and evaluate PairSmell, we conduct an empirical study on 20 C/C++ and Java projects, using 4 established modularization tools to identify two forms of PairSmell: inapt separated pairs InSep and inapt collocated pairs InCol. Our study on 260,003 instances reveals that their architectural impacts are substantial: (1) on average, 14.60% and 20.44% of software entities are involved in InSep and InCol MRs respectively; (2) InSep pairs are associated with 190% more co-changes than properly separated pairs, while InCol pairs are associated with 35% fewer co-changes than properly collocated pairs, both indicating a successful identification of modular structures detrimental to software quality; and (3) both forms of PairSmell persist across software evolution. This evidence strongly suggests that PairSmell can provide meaningful insights for inspecting modular structure, with the identified issues being both granular and fundamental, making the enhancement of modular design more efficient.",True,False,True,True
MH,,TIGER: A Generating-Then-Ranking Framework for Practical Python Type Inference,"Wang, Chong, Zhang, Jian, Lou, Yiling, Liu, Mingwei, Sun, Weisong, Liu, Yang, Peng, Xin",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00019,"Python's dynamic typing system offers flexibility and expressiveness but can lead to type-related errors, prompting the need for automated type inference to enhance type hinting. While existing learning-based approaches show promising inference accuracy, they struggle with practical challenges in comprehensively handling various types, including complex parameterized types and (unseen) user-defined types.In this paper, we introduce TIGER, a two-stage generating-then-ranking (GTR) framework, designed to effectively handle Python's diverse type categories. TIGER leverages fine-tuned pre-trained code models to train a generative model with a span masking objective and a similarity model with a contrastive training objective. This approach allows TIGER to generate a wide range of type candidates, including complex parameterized types in the generating stage, and accurately rank them with user-defined types in the ranking stage. Our evaluation on the ManyTypes4Py dataset shows TIGER's advantage over existing methods in various type categories, notably improving accuracy in inferring user-defined and unseen types by 11.2% and 20.1% respectively in Top-5 Exact Match. Moreover, the experimental results not only demonstrate TIGER's superior performance and efficiency, but also underscore the significance of its generating and ranking stages in enhancing automated type inference.",False,False,False,True
MH,,Janus: Detecting Rendering Bugs in Web Browsers via Visual Delta Consistency,"Zhou, Chijin, Zhang, Quan, Qian, Bingzhou, Jiang, Yu",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00013,"Rendering lies at the heart of our modern web experience. However, the correctness of browser rendering is not always guaranteed, often leading to rendering bugs. Traditional differential testing, while successful in various domains, falls short when applied to rendering bug detection because an HTML file is likely yield different rendered outcomes across different browsers. This paper introduces Visual Delta Consistency, a test oracle to detect rendering bugs in web browsers, aiming to make rendered pages across browsers comparable. Our key insight is that any modifications made to an HTML file should uniformly influence rendering outcomes across browsers. Specifically, when presented with two HTML files that differ only by minor modifications, the reaction of all browsers should be consistent, i.e., either all browsers render them identically or all render them differently. Based on this insight, We implemented it as a practical fuzzer named JANUS. It constructs pairs of slightly modified HTML files and observes the change statuses of the corresponding rendered pages across browsers for bug detection. We evaluated it on three widely-used browsers, i.e., Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. In total, JANUS detected 31 non-crash rendering bugs, out of which 24 confirmed with 8 fixed.",False,False,False,True
